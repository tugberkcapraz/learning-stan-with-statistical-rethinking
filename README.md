### Learning Stan with Statistical Rethinking

In this book I try to use stan for fitting all the models in Statistical Rethinking 2nd edition. 

I am learning Stan while preparing this book. Main body of the code belongs to me. Occasionally I made use of the code I found on the net.

Solomon Kurz's version with BRMS is a great resource and I used some code from that book when I was fitting BRMS models. Also, Vincent Arel Bundock made almost complete translation of the models in the book. I used it for comparison. Lastly, github user @ssp3nc3r made complete translation of the first editon. I learned how to interact from the posterior from his work and applied that perpective to the current work.

I thank all of them for their great work. 

This is a work in progress, so ignore the mistakes. I'll go over it again. Also, if you see any mismatch between my explanations and the book itself, please go with McElreath's explanation.
